Flutter:
  -- It used to build mobile, web, desktop from a single code base.
  -- Excellent performance and rich user interface.
  -- Widgets: Flutter uses a widget-based system for creating user interfaces. Everything in Flutter is a widget, allowing developers to build complex UIs by combining and nesting various widgets.
  -- Hot Reload : In Flutter development, Dart supports a "hot reload" feature, enabling developers to see changes instantly during development without losing the app's state.
  -- collection of packages and plugins available via the pub.dev repository.
  -- Why Use Flutter:
Cross-platform Development: Write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, reducing development time and effort.
Fast Development: The hot reload feature speeds up the development process by allowing immediate feedback on code changes.
Performance: Native compilation results in high-performing applications with smooth user experiences.
